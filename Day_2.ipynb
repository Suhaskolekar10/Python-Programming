    "### 1) Variables :-\n",
    "A variable is a container for storing data values in programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has a name and holds a value that can be changed during execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are used to store different types of data, such as numbers, text, or objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names should be meaningful and follow naming conventions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Naming Convention Rules :- Naming conventions help make code more readable, maintainable, and consistent across projects. Here are some standard rules:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1) Descriptive & Meaningful Names – Use clear and meaningful names (e.g., total_price instead of tp).\n",
    "    \n",
    "2) Case Styles:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Camel Case (myVariableName) – Used in JavaScript, Java, and C#.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Pascal Case (MyClassName) – Common for class names in many languages.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Snake Case (my_variable_name) – Preferred in Python.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3) Constants in Uppercase – Use uppercase letters with underscores (e.g., PI_VALUE = 3.14).\n",
    "    \n",
    "4) Avoid Reserved Keywords – Do not use language-specific keywords as variable names (e.g., class, for, def).\n",
    "    \n",
    "5) No Special Characters or Spaces – Use only letters, digits, and underscores; avoid symbols like @, #, $.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6) Consistent Naming Across Project – Follow the same convention throughout the codebase for better readability."

    "### 2) Data Types :-\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types define the type of data a variable can store. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common data types include integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), characters (char), strings (str), and Boolean (bool). \n",
    "\n",
    "Some programming languages also support complex data types like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and user-defined objects. \n",

    "### 3) Operators :-\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. \n",
